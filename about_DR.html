    <!-- Dungeon Runner Gym history -->

    <section>
        <div class="container history">
            <h3 class="history">Dungeon Runner started as a joke among a few friends.</h3>
            <p>Round about June of 2017, we were playing our weekly role playing game, 
                and talking about how we were all getting out of shape.  Several of us had gym 
                memberships, but rarely if ever went. Someone (we can't remember who)
                opined that if only going to the gym could be as fun as role playing... 
                We started laughing about what classes, equipment, and areas there 
                might be. Over the course of the next week, we all realized how 
                much we all wished this could be a reality.  One of us had dated 
                someone who used to work at a regular gym, so we gave her a call.  
                Through her connections, we visited a few local gyms and talked 
                to the managers or owners about what it took to start and run a gym.  
                The main impediment, of course, was money.
            </p>

            <p>We put together the beginnings of this website, then sent it out 
                to the local RPG community to see how many sign-ups we could get.
                Along with some postings on social media, we got over 1,000 people 
                willing to pay $30/month to join within the first week.  With that 
                and some research into the RPG market and market for gym memberships, 
                we approached some venture capitalists through our college contacts. 
            </p>

            <p>Eventually, we got a few bites from the V-guys and were able to rent a small warehouse 
                to put together our vision.  We hired several people from the local 
                Renaissance Faire as our instructors, as well as expert trainers and instructors
                to fill in the more standard roles, and we were in buisiness.
            </p> 

            <p>We recently upgraded to a new site, with more space for our classes
                and general workout area.  We are expanding further to include a smoothie
                bar, also selling healthy snacks.
